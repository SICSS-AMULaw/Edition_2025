# Detecting Signals, Avoiding Bias: Decision-Making in Law and Medicine

prepared by **Mikołaj Wieczór**

# Abstract
How do people make decisions under uncertainty? This workshop explores the foundations and real-world applications of Signal Detection Theory (SDT), a framework for understanding how humans distinguish signal from noise in ambiguous situations. Focusing on legal (e.g., eyewitness testimony) and health-related (e.g., diagnostic testing) contexts, participants will learn how SDT helps quantify decision-making accuracy, biases, and errors.
The workshop is divided into two parts. In the first, participants will engage in a guided, step-by-step project that introduces core SDT concepts through practical, hands-on analysis using simulated open datasets and accessible statistical tools. In the second part, the group will collaboratively design and carry out their own applied project, integrating what they've learned. The workshop will conclude with a presentation and discussion of the project’s outcomes.
No prior experience with computational methods or statistics is required—just curiosity and a willingness to explore the science of human judgment.
