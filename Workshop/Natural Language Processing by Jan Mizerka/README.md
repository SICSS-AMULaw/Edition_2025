# Ask the Law: Building Legal Chatbots with AI and RAG

prepared by **Jan Mizerka**

# Abstract
Participants of this workshop will explore the use of large language models (LLMs) to build chatbots capable of performing semantic search in legal documents. They will be guided through the process of creating a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) model and a vector database using documents from the Polish Journal of Laws, accessed via the ISAP (Internetowy System Aktów Prawnych) API. Throughout the workshop, participants will gain hands-on experience with free tools such as Google Colab and coding primarily in Python. While programming skills are an asset, no prior experience is required. After acquiring the core techniques, participants will work on their own RAG-based projects, applying the methodology to diverse use cases. This workshop offers valuable insights into how AI and machine learning can enhance the analysis and accessibility of complex legal and social science texts.
